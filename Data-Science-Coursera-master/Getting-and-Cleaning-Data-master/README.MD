dataset: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

It is assumed that all the data is present in the working directory, un-compressed and with original names.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains the script to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. It can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The dataset from 5th step is called `final_averages_data.txt`.
